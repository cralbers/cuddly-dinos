I liked this one until the eleven year old narrator was sexually assaulted behind a dumpster, which was then used as an experience that, once revealed, brought her closer to her sister, who had been physically abused by their now deceased father. However, neither of these traumatic events were brought to any type of resolution, and then the book just kind of ended, and we should be telling girls every goddamned day that they should not have to live with those things, carrying those heavy weights.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "finished 4/2/23\nThis was really damn good. It was interesting reading kingsolver writing a male narrator because so far I’ve only read ones of hers that are narrated by women. The writing style is stunning, because she figured out a way to give an accurate voice to this uneducated, wicked smart kid that doesn’t dumb him down or make him unrelatable. Demon’s blunt self-awareness of his self destruction at the end is so heartbreaking, but I liked the ending I think. The biggest part that resonated with me was the whole thing about the city vs. the green grass and always wanting to be back with who and where you came from and not liking the dead quiet that exists without cicadas or the rain or birds. I’m a little homesick.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "finished 12/7/23\nhad to think about this one for a minute. i loved all of this book except for the last 3 chapters- the other chapters are super informative and fascinating and full of cool facts about our bodies. i was introduced to so many new ideas (mismatch diseases, dysevolution etc) that were so interesting, and definitely will have me thinking differently about my body when it is sick or injured. that said, the last 3 or so chapters bugged me because he begins to address solutions to some of the problems created by mismatch between our bodies and environments, but most, if not all, of his solutions come from a very privileged position. many of the suggested solutions base themselves on the assumption that all people have access and/or the means to access things such as fresh fruits and veggies, probiotics, jobs that require the ‘right’ amount of stress or activity etc. the mismatches between our bodies and modern environment affect all people, and so solutions need to cater to people from all walks of life. i don’t know the answers either, but the ones in the book definitely aren’t for everyone.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The characters are well formed and the narration of their inner thoughts is woven together so seamlessly that the book flows through their timeline in such a way that you don’t realize the book is over until it is and you wish it wasn’t.\nfinished again 7/9/23\ni got my hands on a paperback copy of this one in scotland and then had to read it again- just as good as the first time. i loved being able to read portions of the beginning knowing how things were going to pan out because i just got so much more out of it. lovely and brilliant\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "finished 1/21/24\nlove a good graphic novel- this one is dark and ominous and made me do a lot of thinking about how the world functions when at war. i really liked the character development, which i think was also influenced by this book being a graphic novel, because you can visually see how the author envisioned the characters, rather than just by description. the art was fantastic as well, because it was also dark and dramatic and matched with the mood of the story. i also liked how the major tragedy at the end did end up happening, and the authors didn’t shy away from the pseudo-superheroes not saving the day. at the end of the day, they were just weirdo normal-ish people who just decided to become superheroes based on their elevated egos and anxieties about the state of the world. rorschach was a super interesting character, because his superhero identity started out well intentioned, but then devolved into this villanous character who acted under the pretense of ridding society of evils, but did a lot of evil himself. really well done.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
