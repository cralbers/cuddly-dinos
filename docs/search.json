    "text": "finished 12/7/23\nhad to think about this one for a minute. i loved all of this book except for the last 3 chapters- the other chapters are super informative and fascinating and full of cool facts about our bodies. i was introduced to so many new ideas (mismatch diseases, dysevolution etc) that were so interesting, and definitely will have me thinking differently about my body when it is sick or injured. that said, the last 3 or so chapters bugged me because he begins to address solutions to some of the problems created by mismatch between our bodies and environments, but most, if not all, of his solutions come from a very privileged position. many of the suggested solutions base themselves on the assumption that all people have access and/or the means to access things such as fresh fruits and veggies, probiotics, jobs that require the ‘right’ amount of stress or activity etc. the mismatches between our bodies and modern environment affect all people, and so solutions need to cater to people from all walks of life. i don’t know the answers either, but the ones in the book definitely aren’t for everyone."

I liked this one until the eleven year old narrator was sexually assaulted behind a dumpster, which was then used as an experience that, once revealed, brought her closer to her sister, who had been physically abused by their now deceased father. However, neither of these traumatic events were brought to any type of resolution, and then the book just kind of ended, and we should be telling girls every goddamned day that they should not have to live with those things, carrying those heavy weights."

    "text": "finished 5/3/24\nthis was tricky to get into because i had forgotten a lot of what happened in Dune, and was getting confused between the movies and the book. also i was confused because it starts after the 12 year jihad, which Paul literally spent all of the first book talking about preventing, and then this book started and was like “ok the jihad happened and billions of people died and Paul is Emperor ok go.” but overall i really liked it- i liked that Paul becomes more of a villain and the dynamic of group that is trying to kill him (they all kind of hate each other which was pretty funny even though the dictatorship wins in the end and they are all killed) and the plot was really enticing. was skeptical at first because the jihad was just kind of glossed over within the first couple chapters (it is revisited more in the rest of the book) and it seemed like a big thing to skip, but i can see why it wasn’t super relevant to include all the gory details after reading the whole book. good read!"

The parents love their daughter unconditionally the only way they know how, and the doctors want to heal her unrelentlessly the only way they know how. The second to last chapter is called “The Life or the Soul” and that pretty much sums it up. How do you fix a problem created by the fact that no one party is correct- a war of moralities and differences of opinion in which there is no true positive? I think probably the first step is to listen to each other."

I do wish that I had some type of background that had given me boat and ocean and fishing knowledge, because I think I would have understood a ton more, but that’s also partially on me because I didn’t really do a lot (any) looking into terms that were confusing and just sort of relied on context clues to understand what was going on. but anyways, the ocean is insane and I am definitely not destined to be a fisherman on a swordfish boat."

The writing style is stunning, because she figured out a way to give an accurate voice to this uneducated, wicked smart kid that doesn’t dumb him down or make him unrelatable. Demon’s blunt self-awareness of his self destruction at the end is so heartbreaking, but I liked the ending I think. The biggest part that resonated with me was the whole thing about the city vs. the green grass and always wanting to be back with who and where you came from and not liking the dead quiet that exists without cicadas or the rain or birds.
