**finished 6/1/25** \
listen you're gonna get me everytime with a multigenerational magical realism type beat. every time. women are so strong, it makes me sad. female friendships are necessary and beautiful. a love letter to uruguay, sweeping and haunting. the only part that frustrated me was that it went on a little too long, and i didn't feel like salome's (love that name also) commitment to the tupamaros was completely explained, other than that she wanted to feel connected to the world around her and maintain her friendship with leona. overall, really good. 

3.75/5
