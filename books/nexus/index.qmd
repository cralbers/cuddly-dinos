really fascinating read. sometimes yuval just likes the sound of his own writing, so if you can look past that to the actual info, there is some pretty interesting stuff in here about information networks and how to actually get to the truth of something. also a really good history lesson on how important the internet and instant communication has become for our current government and societal structures as compared to when dissemination of information was slower and analog.
