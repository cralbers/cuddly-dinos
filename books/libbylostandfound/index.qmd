**finished 1/25/25** \
read this for storyline's book club and tbh it was bad. full of plot holes and a storyline that did not make sense. some parts were sweet, but i really didn't like most of the characters, and the whole thing didn't really feel authentic and i was just thinking wtf the whole time.
