**finished 6/7/25** \
a couple of things:
- i did not know enough about shakespeare to fully appreciate this book i think
- really like this whole dark academia genre the more i read it 
- an interesting look at how distorted our sense of reality can become when we are so immersed in a single thing, with a small group of people also completely devoted to the same topic
- writing was really good, i liked how the entire thing was formatted/written like a play
- title is a bit misleading? they are villains?

4/5
