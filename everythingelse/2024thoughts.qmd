i generally think new year's resolutions are pretty not for me, because a new year starts every day, but here are some of my attempts for 2024 anyways.

- get back into journaling
- get a full time job that i feel at least mildly good about
- be worse
- keep reading
- continue to be excited about things that can still happen
